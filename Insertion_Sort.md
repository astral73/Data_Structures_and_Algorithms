We will sort this array a = [22,27,16,2,18,6] by using Insertion Sort algorithm.

Question 1) Write the stages of the above sequence according to the sort type.

Answer 1)
Insertion sort is a sorting algorithm that, in each iteration, places an unsorted element in its proper location.

Stages: [22,27,16,2,18,6] => [16,22,27,2,18,6] => [2,16,22,27,18,6] => [2,16,18,22,27,6] => [2,6,16,18,22,27]

Question 2) Write the Big - O notation.

Answer 2)
O(n ^ 2)

Question 3) Write the Average, Worst and Best cases.

Answer 3)
Worst Case: 0 + 1 + 2 + ... + n - 1 = [(n * n) / 2] => (n ^ 2)

Best Case: n

Average Case: This is the average of best and worst case = n ^ 2

Question 4) What case does the number 18 fall into after the array is sorted? Write.

Answer 4)
When the sorting is finished, the number 18 will be in the "Average Case" part.


We will sort this array b = [7,3,5,8,2,9,4,15,6] by using Insertion Sort algorithm.

Question: Write the first 4 steps of the array according to the Insertion Sort.

Answer:
Step 1) b = [7, 3, 5, 8, 2, 9, 4, 15, 6]

Step 2) b = [3, 7, 5, 8, 2, 9, 4, 15, 6]

Step 3) b = [3, 5, 7, 8, 2, 9, 4, 15, 6]

Step 4) b = [3, 5, 7, 8, 2, 9, 4, 15, 6]
